# Java-Programming-MOOC-by-University-of-Helsinki

This repository contains most of the exercises I've done (week 3 onwards) for the MOOC Java course by the University of Helsinki.
The exercises cover the fundamentals of the Java programming language and my solutions to the exercises.

The IDE I used to complete these exercises was the NetBeans IDE, and the build tool I used was the ANT build tool.

I am now doing courses on Android Development using Android Studio IDE with the Gradle build tool.
Also, I am doing courses on the Spring Framework using the Eclipse IDE using the Maven build tool.
